    "# Plateau Diagnostics Demo\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates the use of isotonic regression plateau diagnostics to distinguish between noise-based flattening (good) and limited-data flattening (bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "When isotonic regression creates flat regions (plateaus) in calibration curves, it could be for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Noise-based flattening (good)**: Adjacent scores truly have similar risks, and pooling reduces variance without losing meaningful resolution.\n",
    "2. **Limited-data flattening (bad)**: Adjacent scores have different risks, but the calibration sample is too small to detect the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provides comprehensive diagnostics to help distinguish between these cases."
