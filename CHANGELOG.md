## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-17

### Added
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Added extensive test suite for validation and quality assurance
  - `tests/data_generators.py`: Realistic test data generators with 8 miscalibration patterns (overconfident neural networks, underconfident random forests, sigmoid distortion, imbalanced binary, multi-modal, weather forecasting, click-through rate, medical diagnosis)
  - `tests/test_mathematical_properties.py`: Mathematical property validation tests for bounds, monotonicity, calibration improvement, and granularity preservation
  - `tests/test_comprehensive_matrix.py`: Comprehensive test matrix covering ~400 test combinations across all calibrators, patterns, sample sizes, and noise levels
  - `tests/validation/calibration_validation.ipynb`: Visual validation notebook with reliability diagrams and performance comparisons

### Fixed
- **ISpline Bounds Issue**: Fixed ISplineCalibrator producing values slightly above 1.0 by adding `np.clip(predictions, 0, 1)` to ensure strict [0,1] bounds
- **Import Issues**: Resolved relative import issues in test modules

### Changed
- **Enhanced CI/CD**: Simplified GitHub Actions workflow with informational linting checks
- **Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development commands and testing instructions

### Technical Improvements
- **Mathematical Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all calibration methods across realistic scenarios
- **Edge Case Handling**: Robust testing for extreme scenarios (perfect calibration, constant predictions, extreme imbalance, small samples)
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Systematic evaluation across multiple data patterns and calibrator configurations

### Quality Assurance
- **Proof of Correctness**: Visual and quantitative validation that all calibration methods are mathematically sound
- **Real-World Testing**: Validation on scenarios mimicking medical diagnosis, click-through rates, weather forecasting, and fraud detection
- **Property Preservation**: Confirmed bounds preservation, monotonicity control, granularity preservation, and ranking correlation maintenance

## [0.2.1] - Previous Release

### Features
- Core calibration algorithms implementation
- Basic metrics and utilities
- Initial CI/CD setup
